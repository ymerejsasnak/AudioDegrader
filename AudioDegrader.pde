/*
AUDIO DEGRADER


- currently ignoring stereo waveforms, just drawing channel 0 whether mono or not

issues: first playback after first processing doesn't usually playback from start of sample (why?!?!?!)
        sometimes certain processes (maybe just lprez?) seem to shift the sample as if something is recording at wrong time (???)
        
minor improvements to wav drawing would be nice
